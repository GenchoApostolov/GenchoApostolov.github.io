# My Personal Website
Branding nowadays is very important and what better way to do that than build your own website. In order to promote myself adequately, I chose to create a website with four pages . A home page, an About page giving more information of who I am and what I do, a page that illustrates the services I offer as a Freelance Designer and Front-End Developer that I named Services and a Contact page, so future clients could get in touch with me. <br>
The development process started with the creation of the website's Wire Frames. The goal of the Low Fidelity Wire Frames is to show how the website would look when finished. <br>
I decided to work with a Web-safe Grayscale Color Palette in order to keep the Wire Frames as simple as possible. Below the image you can see which color was used for what part of the Website Wire Frames.

|Color Value| Used For|
|:----------|:--------|
|#e9e9e9    |headings |
|#c4c4c4    |text     |
|##979797   |images   |
|#4d4d4d    |sections |
|#000000    |buttons  |

The approach I took while designing the Website Wire Frames was Mobile First. The image below illustrates the Wire Frame for the Home page on a Mobile device.

AFter that, the About page was created.
